    summary: >

        Hi! My name is Maxi, I am a Senior Research Engineer at the AI Systems & Architectures team at Microsoft.

        I completed a PhD program at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh. 

        My research focuses on optimizing large-scale deep learning methods for machine translation and language models. 

        With a strong expertise in natural language processing, I am keenly interested in inference optimization and data mining.
